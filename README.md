Atomia Sample Plugins
=====================

Copyright (c) 2012, Atomia AB <info@atomia.com>

Purpose
-------

The intended use of this repository is for it to be a place where you can find
samples of how to integrate with Atomia.

Currently it only contains examples for Atomia Automation Server, but it will
be expanded to include samples of plugins, etc, for our other products
as well.

Get started
-----------

You should first follow the instructions for installing
the Automation Server SDK at
[https://github.com/atomia/sample-plugins/tree/master/AutomationServer/SDK]

Then you can checkout some examples modules for Automation Server:
* A python module for managing github repositorys at [https://github.com/atomia/sample-plugins/tree/master/AutomationServer/Examples/ProvisioningModule/GithubRepo]
* A very simple native module (C#) for managing folders at [https://github.com/atomia/sample-plugins/tree/master/AutomationServer/Examples/ProvisioningModule/Folders]

License
-------

The examples are licensed under the ISC-license. See [https://github.com/atomia/sample-pluginsblob/master/LICENSE-EXAMPLES.txt](LICENSE-EXAMPLES.txt) for details.

The SDK installs a copy of Atomia Automation Server running in development mode (without authentication etc). You have a license to use it for module development
purposes only.
